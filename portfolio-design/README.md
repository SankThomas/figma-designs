# Challenge Time

- I'm offering up a challenge - build out this design in whatever language you want, whichever you think is best for the job, whichever you are comfortable with and when you are done, tag me on Twitter @TSBSankara and I will go through it live on my YouTube stream and credit you with the build.
- Feel free to change all the parts you feel are sub par in terms of text for example so that you can use it in your portfolio as a side project you built - or you can even use the same design for your own portfolio.

## BONUS Challenge

- Build upon the design. For example, I don't have any other pages in the design - not to say that you have to have other pages - but add something to it to make it your own such as adding a CMS like Contentful or Sanity or Netlify CMS to handle blogging and add some content to the blog to make it active. If you find a creative way to improve on it then I will personally email you a free copy of my eBook!
- So let's get to coding! I will do a livestream of me building this out on my YouTube channel [tsbsankara](https://youtube.com/tsbsankara)
